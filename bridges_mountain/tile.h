//Can be put into pretty much any standard library container class - hash tables, binary trees, heaps, etc.

//MAX_SIZE needs to be here so our hash function is more efficient
const size_t MAX_SIZE = 1000; //1000x1000 map is the biggest we handle

	int x,y; //The location of the tile on the grid
	//Mutable allows us to change weight in read-only mode. 
	mutable int from_x,from_y; //The location of the place we came from to get here
	mutable double distance; //Our distance from the start, not as the crow files, but by walking
	//double weight = 0; //Cost to get from the start of a point to a tile  
	Tile() = delete; //All tiles need a valid location, so delete default constructor
